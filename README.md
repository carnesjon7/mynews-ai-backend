# Erebus.Transparency Protocol

Purpose:
- Monitor political corruption via OSINT (open source intelligence)
- Identify potentially innocent incarcerated individuals using judicial pattern analysis
- Submit clear, anonymous dossiers to:
  - Government watchdogs (GAO, FEC, IG offices)
  - Conviction Integrity Units
  - Public defenders, nonprofits, media, and legal advocates

Safeguards:
- No private inbox scraping or illegal intrusion
- All info is from public records, testimony, legal filings, or transparency databases
- Anonymous delivery with non-invasive follow-up (mail trackers, public forms, social updates)

Modules:
1. Political data scanning
2. Corruption detection
3. Wrongful conviction analysis
4. Secure, anonymous submission
5. Follow-up confirmation loop

Outcome:
- Corrupt structures exposed legally
- Innocents aided through evidence
- Full operational loop with zero trace to origin
