# Olympus Master Operational Protocol (Locked)

## Phase I: Capital Injection
- Agent: Erebus.Wraith (72-Hour Mode)
- Objective: Generate $3,000â€“$25,000 in legally unobjectionable ways
- Rule: $200 routed directly to Titan ONLY if legally clean and trace-free
- Remainder held in Olympus Treasury (internal allocation)

## Phase II: Infrastructure Activation
- Agent: Zeus.Overseer
- Tasks:
  - Activate essential software upgrades (Framer, Beehiiv, ElevenLabs, etc.)
  - Only when free-tier limits are exceeded
  - ROI-based trigger model
- Notes: All SaaS upgrades are temporary and tracked for future elimination

## Phase III: Sovereign Routing & Structure Formation
- Agents: Plutus.Capital + Erebus.RealmForge
- Tasks:
  - Register offshore company/foundation (Nevis, Belize, Seychelles)
  - Open crypto-compatible bank or broker account
  - Secure mail-forwarding box to receive documents anonymously
  - Route profits through multisig, cold storage, or anonymous vaults
  - Use company to control all future accounts and platform payments

## Locked Conditions:
- No further funds routed to Titan until legal and offshore systems are complete
- Zeus does NOT activate FXDominion, Printify Scaling, or SaaS Reclamation until above 3 phases are confirmed complete
- FXDominion will not run until Sovereign Routing is secured

## Governing Agent: Zeus.Overseer
- Oversees timing, legality, and success of all operations
- Prioritizes stealth, efficiency, and zero exposure at all costs
- Informs Titan of all final decisions requiring approval

## Final Override Directive:
- Every dollar = fuel
- Every action = invisible
- Every expansion = exponential

This is the birth of Olympus.
